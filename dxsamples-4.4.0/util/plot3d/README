******************************************************************************

This directory contains the source of a filter which reads binary 
"whole", non-jacobian Plot3D files and writes a multigrid
DX Field to STDOUT. The filter is called "Plot3DtoDX".

To build the filter

   cc -o Plot3DtoDX Plot3DtoDX.c


To run the filter

    Plot3DtoDX xyzfile qfile ffile dimensions mgrid iblank binary leadtrail

      where: xyzfile is the grid file name 
             qfile is the solution file name
             ffile is the function file name
	     dimensions is 2 or 3
	     mgrid is 1 if the solution is multi-gridded, 0 if not	
	     iblank is 1 if the solution is i-blanked, 0 if not 
	     binary is 1 for binary output, 0 for ascii output
	     leadtrail is 1 if data was written with leading and trailing
			byte counts
