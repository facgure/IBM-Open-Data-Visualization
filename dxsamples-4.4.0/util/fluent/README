******************************************************************************
 
The files in this directory facilitate the use of Data Explorer 
with Fluent data. Included is a filter which reads Fluent data and writes
a DX format file.  This filter is the same one that can be found
at the Data Explorer repository at Cornell University. 
 
******************************************************************************

Filter name: Fluent2DX.c 

Fluent2DX.c is the source file for a filter that reads Fluent Universal
file data in ASCII format and produces a Data Explorer Group of Fields,
one for each solved variable (velocity is stored as a single 3-vector)

It should compile easily using:
 
   cc -o Fluent2DX Fluent2DX.c
  
The execution syntax is: 

   Fluent2DX fluent_universal_file_name > Data_Explorer_file_name
  
******************************************************************************

Programs and data show some example visualizations of Fluent data
can be found on the Data Explorer repository at Cornell University.
