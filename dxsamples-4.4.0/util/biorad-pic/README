******************************************************************************
 
The files in this directory facilitate the use of Data Explorer 
with Bio-Rad(TM) .PIC Image data. Included is a filter which reads Bio-Rad
.PIC Image File data and writes a DX format file. 
 
******************************************************************************

Filter name: PIC2dx.c 

PIC2dx.c is the source file for a filter that reads Bio-Rad .PIC
file data in ASCII format and produces a Data Explorer Group of Fields,
one for each image layer.

It should compile easily using:
 
   cc -o pic2dx PIC2dx.c
  
The execution syntax is: 

   pic2dx -i inputfile -o outputfile -series
