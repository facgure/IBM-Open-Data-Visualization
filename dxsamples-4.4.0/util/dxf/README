README
==============

The DXF-DX format converter supports many of the entity types
defined in the DXF file format.  It provides simple command
line options to specify input and output file names, resolution
of certain primitives and a verbose operation flag.

Command Line Options:
=====================

    dxf2dx [-h] [-v] [-r'n'] [filein [fileout]]

	with:

	   -h:      this help message.
	   -v:      verbose operation.
 	   -r'n':   resolution of circle and arc primitves (default 40).

	and:

	   filein:  input file name (default stdin).
	   fileout: output file name (default dxf.dx).


Known Limitations:
==================
-- The Entity Coordinate System (ECS) for 2-D primitives is not resolved
   correctly.  This means that some 2-D primitives will appear in 
   the wrong location in space.
 
-- The entire DXF file is read into memory before any DX geometry is created.
   Then the entire DX object is created.  Then the DX Object is written out
   to disc.  This is kind of wasteful in memory.  A better implementation
   would convert items as they are encountered in the DXF file.

Supported Entities:
===================

  2-D Primitives:

	CIRCLE		(including cylinders)
	ARC		(including partial cylinders)
	LINE


  3-D Primitives:

	3DLINE
	3DFACE
	POLYLINE	(inluding poly face meshes, 3-d meshes and polylines)
	VERTEX

  Block Inserts:

	INSERT
	BLOCK


Unsupported Entities:
======================

        ATTDEF
        ATTRIB
        DIMENSION
        POINT
        SHAPE
        SOLID
        TEXT
        TRACE
        VIEWPORT


Location of sample DXF files
=============================

        In this directory are two sample dxf files: x29.dxf and
        balloon.dxf. You will also find a makefile to make
        dxf2dx. See MANIFEST for a brief description of the files
        in this directory.

	anonymous ftp to avalon.chinalake.nav.mil://pub
	to find hundreds of sample DXF files, format
	specifications, 20-30 other file format specs
	as well as samples of these other formats.
