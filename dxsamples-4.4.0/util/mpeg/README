This README describes how to make mpeg movies from Data Explorer
images.

There is a public domain encoder and player available from
Berkeley. You can ftp the package:
   ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/bmt1r1.tar.gz
It is well documented.

The encoder requires that images be in yuv or ppm format.
You can use DX to write yuv format images by specifying
"yuv" as the format to WriteImage.  (This was added too
late to be included in the documentation for WriteImage
in the Data Explorer User Reference. The format is
Abekas YUV). An example visual program, "write_yuv.net",
is included in this directory. It writes a series of
yuv-format images: iso.0.yuv, iso.1.yuv, etc.

Use the encoder to create an mpeg file. You need a param
file; one is included here, called "default.param". 
For example:
    .../mpeg_encode default.param

Then you can use the player to play the mpeg movie. For example:
    .../mpeg_play output.mpg

WHAT IF YOUR MPEG DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT?
  Note that Data Explorer v 3.1 had a bug which caused incorrect
yuv images to sometimes be written. In later versions this bug
has been fixed (to check your version, type "dx -version" or use
the Product Information choice from the Help menu).
  Make sure that you are writing only one frame per file (the default
behavior of WriteImage yuv format is to append new frames if a file
already exists; set the frame parameter to 0 to ensure that new frames
overwrite previous frames).
  Make sure that you have 
BASE_FILE_FORMAT        YUV
YUV_FORMAT      ABEKAS

in your .param file.
