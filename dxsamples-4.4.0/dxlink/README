The files in this directory show some examples of how to
use dxlink to communicate with Data Explorer. Copy the
files in this directory to your own directory, rename the
appropriate makefile (Makefile_ibm6000, etc.) to Makefile,
then type either

make 
       to make all the demos
or
       make sealevel
or
       make maptoplane
or
       make xapp 
or
       make xapp_supervise 
or
       make demoapp 

to make an executable. To run, simply type 
       sealevel
or
       maptoplane
or
       xapp 
or
       xapp_supervise 
or
       demoapp netlist 

The sealevel example sends a series of isosurface values to
a visual program.

The maptoplane example not only sends a series of maptoplane
positions, but it also receives information (the maximum value
on the maptoplane) back from Data Explorer.

The xapp example creates a standalone motif application which
presents a set of radio buttons. Depending on which radio
button is pushed, a different set of Data Explorer script
language commands are sent to the executive. Output is listened
for and handled using DXOutputValue and DXLSetValueHandler.
The output (the max value of the field) is presented in the
motif window.

The xapp_supervise example creates a standalone motif application which
presents a set of radio buttons. Depending on which radio
button is pushed, a different filename is sent to a previously
defined macro. An image is created and displayed within the user-
created gui. Interaction within the image is possible using
the SuperviseWindow and SuperviseState modules.

The demoapp example creates a graphical user interface containing
a number of thumbnail images (specified in the netlist file). When
the user presses a button corresponding to the thumbnail, a visual
program is loaded so that the user can see the particular visualization.
