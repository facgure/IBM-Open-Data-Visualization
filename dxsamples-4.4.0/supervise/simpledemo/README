This directory contains a simple preliminary demonstration of DX User
Interactors.  The demo allows you interactively zoom the camera
in and out on an object. The demonstration in this directory is intended
to be very simple, to show the basic mechanism of creating a user
interactor. For a more complex demonstation, showing more of the
capabilities of user interactors, see the demonstration in ../complexdemo.

First copy this directory to someplace where you can modify it. 
To run the demo, you must first create the run-time loadable
interactor file.  This is done by first going to the interactor 
subdirectory and typing:

make -f Makefile_arch interactors

where arch is one of ibm6000, sgi, alphax, hp700 and solaris.  
Once the interactors file has been created,
you can return to this directory and execute the 'demo' script that
you'll find here.  Run 'demo', and when DX comes up, put it in 
execute-on-change mode.  

You will see an isosurface appear. Press the left mouse button down and
drag to the right. You will zoom in on the isosurface. Now drag in a
vertical direction. You will zoom out.


Note: Two platforms (sun4 and aviion) do not support runtime
loadable modules. For these, you will need to create a separate
dxexec executable incorporating your custom interactors. For
an example, see samples/supervise/interactors.
