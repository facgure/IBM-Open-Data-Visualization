This directory contains a medium-complexity demonstration of DX User
Interactors.  The demo incorporates picking to place a
text glyph of a picked data value, along with placing a caption at
a place on the screen where the user types characters.
For a more complex demonstation, showing more of the
capabilities of user interactors, see the demonstation in ../complexdemo.

First copy this directory to someplace where you can modify it. 
To run the demo, you must first create the run-time loadable
interactor file.  This is done by first going to the interactor 
subdirectory and typing:

make -f Makefile_arch interactors

where arch is one of ibm6000, sgi, alphax, hp700 and solaris.  
Once the interactors file has been created,
you can return to this directory and execute the 'demo' script that
you'll find here.  Run 'demo', and when DX comes up, put it in 
execute-on-change mode.  

Click the left mouse button in the image window to place text
glyphs. To remove the glyphs, use the interactor provided.

Type keys anywhere in the image to place a caption. Only one caption is
supported, so that if you type more keys later they are simply added
to the existing caption. For a more complex demo which allows captions
to be moved and modified, see ../complexdemo.
