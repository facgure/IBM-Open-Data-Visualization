This directory contains sample .c, .mdf, and makefiles for
creating the sample modules discussed in the Programmer's
reference. For instructions on how to create the various
modules, please refer to the Programmer's reference.

As one example, to create the hello module, type
   make -f Makefile_architecturename hello

This will make a version of dxexec which includes the hello module.

To run dx using the hello module, type
   dx -mdf hello.mdf -exec ./dxexec

Note that if you load the visual programs in this directory
without specifying the mdf file to the ui, or if you try to run 
without specifying the appropriate dxexec, errors will occur.

Because Data Explorer does not distribute HDF libraries, we do
not include a makefile for the import examples, which for illustrative
purposes use HDF. If you want to compile these programs, you can start 
with the appropriate template for your architecture in /usr/lpp/samples/user 
(e.g. Makefile_inboard_ibm6000, or Makefile_inboard_sgi).
If you have the HDF libraries on your system, then simply add the 
appropriate library to the LIBS line and add the appropriate include 
directory to the CFLAGS line.  If you do not have the HDF libraries on 
your system, and just want to use the import .c files as a template, 
you'll need to comment out all of the HDF specific code before compiling 
the programs. Note that you can also compile this as an
outboard or runtime-loadable module by using the appropriate makefile 
and modifying the .mdf file for the import program as appropriate 
(see the examples in samples/user).
