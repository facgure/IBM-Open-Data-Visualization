<h3>...about the visualization</h3>
<b>The Digital Aerontautical Chart Supplement</b>(DACS) is a subset 
of the positional data used by the
<a href="http://www.faa.gov" TARGET="_parent">
Federal Aviation Administration</a> and the
<a href="http://www.noaa.gov" TARGET="_parent">
National Oceanic and Atomspheric Administration</a>
to manage the National Airspace System. DACS is updated every 56 days.
<p>
Shown here is a visualization of DACS using data from the
Northeast superimposed on the outlines of the states.
<p>
The yellow lines represent <i>victor</i> airways.  These are flightpaths
used by aircraft operating in the IFR system below 18,000 feet above
sea level.  A pilot must file a flight plan based on these routes
(or the on the jet routes for the portion of her flight above 18,000
feet).  Just prior to takeoff, she would receive a clearance from air traffic
control specifying which of these flightpaths to follow.
<p>
You can try zooming into a depiction of the airways and then turning
on the display of intersection names.  Every intersection is given
a 5 letter name.  Look for <fixed>BOSOX</fixed> intersection southwest
of Boston or <fixed>LBSTA</fixed> which is northeast of Boston.
The instrument approach into Pease International in Portsmouth, NH
is well known for a sequence of intersection names: 
<fixed>ITAWT, ITAWA, PUDYE, TAAHT, IDEED</fixed>

Jet routes are used between 18,000 and 60,000 feet above sea level.
If you're above 60,000 feet you're own your own.  Just don't forget
your oxygen bottle.

The green balls are airports equipped to provide a surveillance
radar approach - a procedure normally used to assist a pilot who
has lost navigational capability.  The silver balls represent the
locations of long range radar facilities.  The orange circles are
selected airports sized according the length of the longest runway.

<h3>...about the visual program</h3>
This visual program reads connectionless data.  Since each data point
represents an intersection, consequtive points in the data set are
connected using a combination of a special import filter
which detects begin and end points of airways, <i>Compute</i>, <i>Mark</i>,
and <i>Replace</i>.
<h3>...about the conversion to web page</h3>
The original net has 4 image tools.  Three of these tools provide the images
you see here.  The fourth is routed off unless you select the vrml option 
in the control panel.  The subsequent execution would cause an additional
browser window to open showing the vrml world.  This doesn't work with
Internet Explorer 4.0 or Netscape 4.05.
