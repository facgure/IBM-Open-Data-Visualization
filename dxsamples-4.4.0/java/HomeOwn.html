<h3>...about the visualization</h3>
Over the past 90 years, as Americans have bought and sold
homes, various regions of the U.S. have experienced varying
rates of growth of home ownership.  You would expect to find
a general trend towards increasing home ownership, but would
the trend be the same in all states?  Would some parts of the
previous century show significantly different changes in
the rate of home ownership than other parts? 
<p>
<h4>The home ownsership data set</h4>
<p>
Clearly ownership increased in Alabama from 1900 to 1990,
but with any significant number of states you can't
glean useful information by examining the numbers.
<blockquote>
<small>
<pre> Home Ownership
state 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990
AL 34.4 35.1 35.0 34.2 33.6 49.4 59.7 66.7 70.1 70.5
AZ 57.5 49.2 42.8 44.8 47.9 56.4 63.9 65.3 68.3 64.2
AR 47.7 46.6 45.1 40.1 39.7 54.5 61.4 66.7 70.5 69.6

<h3>...about the visual program</h3>
The elevation of individual states represents the rate of home ownership
in the state.  The color of each state represents the change in the rate
of home ownership from the previous time period.
<p>
This Data Explorer visualization uses a <i>Sequencer</i> to produce
an animation.  Each frame in the animation shows data corresponding
to a interval in time.  Data Explorer takes 5 - 10 seconds to 
create each frame.  Then the assembled frames are presented quickly
in order to create the impression of motion.

<h3>...about the conversion to web page</h3>
In the <i>Mode</i> menu, select <i>Sequence</i>.  You'll see
the frames appear slowly as Data Explorer computes each one.
When the <i>Execution</i> indicator turns black, Data Explorer
has finished executing and the animation begins.  Terminate it
at any time by changing the Mode selector.  You can also change
the behavior of the animation by selecting <i>Faster</i>,
<i>Slower</i>, <i>Loop</i>, or <i>Palindrome</i>.
